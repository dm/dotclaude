# Quick Spec

Write a specification for a simple, well-understood task.

**CRITICAL: This skill is PLANNING ONLY. Do NOT write code, edit source
files, run tests, create branches, or execute any implementation work.
Your only output is the spec file and a summary for the user. Use
`/do-spec` to execute an approved spec.**

## Inputs

`$ARGUMENTS` — A short description of the work.

## Process

### Step 1: Create the spec

1. Generate a short kebab-case slug from the description.
2. Create `.wip/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>/`.
3. Write `spec.md` using the quick template (see below).
4. Fill in: title, context (from user's description), scope (inferred —
   state assumptions explicitly), approach (your proposed plan), and
   acceptance criteria.

### Step 2: Present for review

Present your understanding:

```
## Spec: [Title]

**Branch:** `feat/<slug>`
**Spec:** `.wip/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>/spec.md`

**Understanding:** [1-2 sentences]

**Approach:**
[Brief plan]

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] ...

Approve this spec? Any changes?
```

**STOP — Wait for user approval.**

If changes requested, update the spec and present again.
When approved, update spec status to `approved`.
